/*Program:- Write an application to simulate the vehicles crossing a toll bridge on a motorway.
*           You need to simulate the environment for five vehicles that are approaching the bridge and
*           toll booth. The vehicles are numbered from one to five. The vehicles have to go through the
*           following five stages:
*           Start the journey
*           Arrive at the toll
*           Enter the tollbooth
*           Exit the tollbooth
*           Cross the bridge
*           The vehicles can be in any of the stages in parallel, except the third stage as only one
*           vehicle can enter the toll booth at a time. The simulation is performed by having one thread
*           for each vehicle.
